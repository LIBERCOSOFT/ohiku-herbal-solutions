                  systems that directly affect your health .
                </p>
                <p class="fw-bolder">
                  HEALTH IS NOT JUST THE ABSENCE OF DISEASE; HEALTH IS THE
                  OPTIMAL FUNCTIONING OF ALL BODILY ORGANS AND LIMBS.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Health is affected by what one eats, drinks, how and when one
                  sleeps, how and what type of exercise is done, and of course
                  one’s level of stress. Health can also be influenced by
                  genetics, body constitution and even by our emotions and
                  thoughts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Health is affected by environmental toxins such as pesticides
                  sprayed on foods, water or air pollution, plastics and other
                  things that damage the environment, including our inner
                  environment of our bodies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To maximize health, we must do our best to keep our bodies
                  functioning at the highest level. Herbs play a big role in
                  that as many functions need support. If our kidneys cannot
                  filter toxins to the fullest degree, some people may have skin
                  problems because the toxins do not get released from the body
                  completely. That is why herbs to help the kidney function to
                  its maximum are very useful at all stages of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The liver must function properly for many reasons. If the
                  liver is overloaded with too much sugar (fructose in
                  particular), this can lead to problems with the pancreas and
                  to diabetes. If the thyroid gland is either underworking
                  (hypothyroid) or overworking (hyperthyroid) there are many
                  things that will be affected negatively.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As people age, they normally suffer some decrease in
                  functionality in general. But it does not have to be to the
                  extent we see in modern day society. Many people believe old
                  age must accompany a break down in the body systems. This is
                  not necessarily true. There may be some decline in function,
                  but it can be minimized with a proper healthy lifestyle. Herbs
                  play a big role in optimizing health and preventing disease.
                  That is why Maimonides, the greatest physician who ever lived,
                  utilized herbs for his patients.
