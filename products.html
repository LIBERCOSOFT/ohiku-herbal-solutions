              <p>
                The practice of herbal medicine is the oldest form of healthcare
                which has been used for decades in developing and developed
                countries. According to literature approximately 50,000 plant
                species are stated to have medicinal properties. Thus, the basis
                of modern medicinal drugs such as aspirin, morphine, digitoxin
                and quinine were synthesized through scientific validation of
                herbal medicine. Plant based drugs awareness advanced gradually
                and has been passed on, therefore setting a foundation for many
                traditional medicine systems around the globe is what Ohiku
                Herbal Solution about.

              <p>
                Ohiku Herbal Solution has gained cumulative popularity in
                today’s medical practice. These treatments are the synthesis of
                therapeutic experiences of generations of traditional physicians
                for over hundreds of years. However, most of these applications
                are unorthodox, with over 80% of the world’s population
                depending on some form of traditional medicine. The increase in
                the use of herbal products is due to their cultural
                acceptability, availability, affordability, efficacy and safety
                claims. This upsurge has led to the improvements in the quality
                and analysis of herbal products to be made with more specialised
                process.

              <p>
                Also known as herbalism or herbology, herbal medicine is a field
                that deals with the use of plants and their many parts,
                including roots, leaves, flowers and extracts to treat a wide
                variety of conditions. Ohiku's practice of herbal medicine is
                based on the principle that in order to cure a person, treatment
                should be targeted on the underlying cause rather than the signs
                and symptoms. For this reason, Ohiku's Herbal Solutions often
                goes together with other natural therapies including diet
                modification, enhancement of physical activity, yoga and tai
                chi, among others.

              <p>
                Detox diets are said to eliminate toxins from your body, improve
                health, and promote weight loss. They often involve the use of
                laxatives, diuretics, vitamins, minerals, teas, and other foods
                thought to have detoxing properties. The term “toxin” in the
                context of detox diets is loosely defined. It typically includes
                pollutants, synthetic chemicals, heavy metals, and processed
                foods, which can negatively affect health, and that's why Ohiku
                is there to help you premiumly for your detoxification.
